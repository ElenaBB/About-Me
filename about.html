					<p>To avoid boring official CV format I'll tell you about my background in brief and brisk)
My home town is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seversk">Seversk</a>, located in Tomsk region. If you watched the "Simpsons", you should know the "yellow" family resides in Springfield - home to power plant. There is also the one in Seversk named "Siberian Chemical Combine", originally established to "eliminate the US monopoly in nuclear armaments". Currently SCC is one of the world's largest nuclear centers. 
And I was born at the end of the "cold war" in 1984. </p> 

				<p>In 1991, the year the USSR was dissoluted I went to school, finished it in already another country in 2001, and soon was accepted to <a href="http://tsu.ru/english/">Tomsk State University</a>, my Alma mater, Foreign Languages Department. Along with learning English grammar, phonetics, German (ich habe nur alles vergessen, aber mochte die Sprache verbessern), finished the Military Department as a liasion officer. But it has nothing to do with the cold war. </p> 
				
				
				
				<p> Three years of teaching English at <a href="http://tpu.ru/en/">Tomsk Polytechnic University</a> at Computer Science and Engineering Department followed my graduation. Along that I took part in Fulbright program, but passed only the I round in Moscow, twice.</p> 
				<p> Can't but mention my participation in the great exchnage program in Poland under AISEC in March 2011. I got unforgettable experince of working and living abroad.</p> 
				<p> Now I am emloyed as a translator at a Tomsk (Seversk neighbour) IT company.</p>
